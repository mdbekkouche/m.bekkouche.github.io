Loops are unwound 32 times.

From the counterexample, LocFaults calculates MCS by exploring the graph in DFS from top to bottom and by deviating at most '1' conditional statements.
Solver: CP OPTIMIZER
By deviating '0' condition(s), we obtain:

3. MCS in CSP_a:

Runtime of the method that compute MCS: 0.05

The resulats:
1. Elapsed time during DFS exploration and MCS calculation: 0.117
2. The sum of computation time of MCS isolations only: 0.05

Suspicious instructions:
The number of suspicious instructions:0

By deviating '1' condition(s), we obtain:
