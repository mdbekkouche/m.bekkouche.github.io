Loops are unwound 10 times.

From the counterexample, LocFaults calculates MCS by exploring the graph in DFS from top to bottom and by deviating at most '0' conditional statements.
Solver: CP OPTIMIZER
By deviating '0' condition(s), we obtain:

The system is infeasible

This constraint system is nonlinear: to calculate MCSs, we use the solver IBM ILOG CP OPTIMIZER of CPLEX
